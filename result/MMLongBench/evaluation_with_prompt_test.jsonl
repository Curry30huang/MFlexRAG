The text states that in this type of mutation, part of the untranslated region of the mRNA transcript will be included within the translation process, leading to the addition of more amino acids not originally present in the protein sequence until another stop codon is encountered. This results in the synthesis of a longer and larger protein with an abnormal pathological lengthening of the polypeptide chain.\n\nTherefore, the transcript that has been included in the translation process in a re-sense mutation is the untranslated region of the mRNA transcript from the last exon of the gene, which is now being translated as if it were part of the coding sequence.", "ground_truth": "part of the un-translated region of the mRNA transcript", "explanation": "{\"binary_correctness\": 1}", "error": null}
