However, I can guide you on how to approach this problem if you have the survey data available.\n\nTo find the type of STEP (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) major with the largest gender gap in consistent employment and the highest pay in the Pew Research Center survey from January 2018, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n1. **Access the Survey Data**: Obtain the full dataset from the Pew Research Center survey. This dataset should contain information on various STEM majors, their corresponding gender gaps in employment, and the average pay for each major.\n\n2. **Filter the Data**: Focus on the STEM majors specifically. You might need to filter out non-STEM-related majors.\n\n3. **Identify Gender Gaps**: Look at the gender gap in employment for each STEM major. The gender gap can be calculated as the difference between the percentage of men and women employed in a particular major.\n\n4. **Identify Highest Paying Majors**: Determine which STEM majors have the highest average pay.\n\n5. **Compare and Analyze**: Compare the STEM majors that have both the largest gender gap in employment and the highest average pay.\n\nIf you have the survey data, you could use statistical software like Excel, R, or Python to perform these analyses. If you don't have the data but have access to the survey report, you might need to extract the relevant information manually.\n\nIf you can provide more details or the actual data, I can help you further by analyzing it step-by-step."}

The term \"re-sense mutation\" is defined in the context of the last exon of a gene where a stop codon might be converted into a functional codon through a point mutation. This results in the inclusion of an untranslated region within the mRNA transcript during translation, leading to the synthesis of a longer and larger protein.\n\nIn the context of the question, the relevant information is found in section 7.6.2.4, which describes re-sense mutations. The text states that in this type of mutation, part of the untranslated region of the mRNA transcript will be included within the translation process, leading to the addition of more amino acids not originally present in the protein sequence until another stop codon is encountered. This results in the synthesis of a longer and larger protein with an abnormal pathological lengthening of the polypeptide chain.\n\nTherefore, the transcript that has been included in the translation process in a re-sense mutation is the untranslated region of the mRNA transcript from the last exon of the gene, which is now being translated as if it were part of the coding sequence."}
